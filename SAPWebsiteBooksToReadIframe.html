        <h2>The Magic Of Reality</h2>
        <h4>By Richard Dawkins</h4>
        <p>
          This book is an interesting read. Each chapter consists of a question that we have all
          probably wondered at some point, and tries to answer it scientifically. It starts by showing
          some classical myths by various cultures, and then procedes to say that they are all wrong.
          Although it could be considerd culturally innapropiate, the book is scientifically very interesting.
          You will learn about how we ended up here, how rainbows are formed and where the universe comes from.
          If you want to learn about some things, and learn a bit of mythology along the way, I recommend this
          book.

          Buy it <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/search?index=books&linkCode=qs&keywords=9781451675047">here</a>.
