    One of the coolest thing about Science is the Scientific Method itself. The Scientific Method
    means that that everything we do as scientists is reproducible. So somebody in a laboratory
    across the World can reproduce the same experiments that I conduct in my laboratory at
    Columbia University. The Scientific Method also means that our results are repeatable, and not
    random, unreliable or simply made up. So when I, or others, re-do experiments the same
    results are produced. Finally, the Scientific Method means that scientific outcomes or
    conclusions have been peer reviewed. So other scientists have to agree that the outcomes or
    conclusions of my science are valid before I can publish my work in a reputable venue. The
    Scientific Method is in place to ensure that Science is trustworthy. If only we had a similar
    method in place for News!
